                    <p>Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms", "Terms of Service") carefully before using the EduMore360 website and platform (the "Service") operated by EduMore360 ("us", "we", or "our").</p>
                    
                    <p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the Service.</p>
                    
                    <p>By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not access the Service.</p>
                    
                    <h2>1. Accounts</h2>
                    
                    <p>When you create an account with us, you must provide accurate, complete, and up-to-date information at all times. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of the Terms, which may result in immediate termination of your account on our Service.</p>
                    
                    <p>You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Service and for any activities or actions under your password, whether your password is with our Service or a third-party service.</p>
                    
                    <p>You agree not to disclose your password to any third party. You must notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.</p>
                    
                    <h2>2. Subscriptions</h2>
                    
                    <p>Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.</p>
                    
                    <p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or we cancel it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting our customer support team.</p>
                    
                    <p>A valid payment method, including credit card or mobile money, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize us to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.</p>
                    
                    <p>Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, we will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.</p>
                    
                    <h2>3. Free Trial</h2>
                    
                    <p>We may, at our sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time ("Free Trial").</p>
                    
                    <p>You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for the Free Trial.</p>
                    
                    <p>If you do enter your billing information when signing up for the Free Trial, you will not be charged by us until the Free Trial has expired. On the last day of the Free Trial period, unless you cancelled your Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable subscription fee for the type of Subscription you have selected.</p>
                    
                    <p>At any time and without notice, we reserve the right to (i) modify the terms and conditions of the Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.</p>
